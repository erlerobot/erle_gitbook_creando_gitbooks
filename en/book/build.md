# Build

After you pushed content using **git** or the **editor**, GitBook.io will start different builds:

- **website**: it will generate the website
- **json**: il will extract metadata about the book (summary, introduction, ...)
- **epub**: it will generate the epub download
- **pdf**: it will generate the pdf download

### List builds

The **Activity** tab on your book let you follow the evolution of your builds.
